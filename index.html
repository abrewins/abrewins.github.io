	<h2>About the Author/Creator</h2>
	<p>My name is Aidan Brewins, welcome to my photography website. I have created this website for the Duke of Edinburgh's Gold Award.
	   I have chosen photography as the main them because my late grandfather taught me how to perform this style of digital art when I was a younh child.
	   Eversince his teaching, I have become hooked on 'capturing a moment in time'. Whether its images of animals, architecture, people or the countryside. 
	   I hope you enjoy looking at some of my best photgraphs that are scattered throughout my website.</p>
